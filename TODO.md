Before the jam:
- Manage sounds and music.

Eventually:
- Add icons to the electron build.
- Add keyboard support to the screens.
- Add url/history/back-button support to the screens.
- Consider letting users reset their game from the title screen.
- Consider transitioning between screens (title -> options, title -> game).
- Teach the audio manager to cycle between tracks w/ local storage.
