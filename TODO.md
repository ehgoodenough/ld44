NEXT STEPS
- Jump physics are great.
- Enemy threat is too strong. Decrease projectile enemies, and add simpler enemies that simply on touch. Make them move or stay still.
- Add more things to do other than attack. Make more goals that require doing that awesome jumping. Pickups, mostly. Things that let you traverse better.
- De-couple the ammo from health. It should be a finite supply, but not something that kills you if you don't pick it up.
- Prettify the sky. Add static decorations to the levels.
- End the level with a satisfactory boss fight and ending screen.
- Start the level with a tutorial to jump and shoot. Don't scroll until then.
- Give sprites to the goodies and baddies.

BUGS
- Fix the turrets when rotating from 360deg to 0deg.
- Fix a super-jump when jumping just after ledge-grabbing.
- Fix gimpy dropping when on slopes.
- Hitting down while in the air sometimes snaps you to the level?
- Sometimes an enemy will die and the death animation is delayed and off-position.
- Why is there some slight drag between entities on the level and the level itself?

POLISH
- Add icons to the electron build.
- Add keyboard support to the screens.
- Add url/history/back-button support to the screens?
