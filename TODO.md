BUGS
- Fix the turrets when rotating from 360deg to 0deg.
- Fix a super-jump when jumping just after ledge-grabbing.

- Hitting down while in the air sometimes snaps you to the level?
- Sometimes an enemy will die and the death animation is delayed and off-position.
- Why is there some slight drag between entities on the level and the level itself?
