- End the level after a certain point!!
- End screen with results, and options to restart or return to title screen.
- A sound should play when entities get hit, shoot, pickup hearts, explode. Sounds! avatar screaming, gun kuthunk kuthunking, gun reving up and down, shots hitting target, enemies dying.

DESIGN
- Hearts should look like hearts.
- Dropped hearts are missing a) physics and b) collision!!
- Projectiles do not leave the frame. Projectiles return to you after you shoot them? Projectiles float towards you if you're not shooting.
- Picking up the hearts of your enemies
- The hearts ui should list how many hearts you have exactly.
- The hearts should look like hearts, both as projectiles and pickups.
- The hearts should beat to the music.
SCOPE CREEP
- Different player weapons?
- Enemies that just stand there but kill on touch. Enemies that move around. Enemies with slow moving projectiles, spread projectiles, homing missiles, timed lasers on and off, spikes/cactus, mines.
- Equipment like parachute/rope?
- Boss!
